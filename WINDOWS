Tie-LevelDB can be build under Windows by meeting the following conditions:

1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express Edition (cl, link, nmake).
2. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1.
3. Install Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4 (windows headers).
2. Merge Boost C++ v1.47 (already done in the windows port of that module).
3. Deploy required DLLs (already done in the windows port of that module).

To build the module open "Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)" and
type the following commands:

cd Tie-LevelDB-x.xx
perl Makefile.PL
nmake
nmake test
nmake install

Last command will install the module system wide and also deploy the
required extra DLLs.
